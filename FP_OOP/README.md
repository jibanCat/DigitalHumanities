# Code samples for FP and OOP

This blog post gives a simple example comparing functional programming and
object-oriented these two paradigms, but using Ruby.

- `Programming Paradigms, Python code samples.ipynb`: original source please
  find this great Ruby conference talk in 2017, [4 Programming Paradigms in 45 Minutes by Aja Hammerly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TBq__oKUzk). In this video, she introduced 4 types of programming paradigms:
    - Object-Oriented
    - Functional
    - Logic
    - Procedure  
 using 4 different languages. It's too hard for me to translate code samples in Logic Programming (Prolog) and Procedure (Assembly) to Python. So, allow me to dodged these two sections :P
